# Kaoru Ishikawa Dedication

This dedication page was built as a way to practice using Express and Express-Handlebars to create a multi-page website with reusable header assets.

This project started on 7/15/2020 and was completed 7/22/2020.

If I were to re-make this project with no time constraint:

1) I would include additional javascript logic so that each of the 7 quality control diagrams could be made dynamically by the user. 

2) Include the ability to not only generate your own diagrams based on data provided but to also email/save/print said diagrams.

3) Implement media queries so that each page would be displayed aestetically depending on display size.

Notes for improvement:

1) I should have dedicated more time to whiteboarding and planning the project rather than jumping in code first.
